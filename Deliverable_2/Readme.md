		patient Blood Sugar Page and submit their data by click "Record" button
		and save their comment by "save" button in comment area. 

		But only once a day, once patient submitted their data the "Record" button
		the button will turn into grey and "Record" button will change into "Recorded" button, 
		and patient cannot click the button anymore.
